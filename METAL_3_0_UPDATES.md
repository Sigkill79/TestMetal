```objc
typedef struct
{
    matrix_float4x4 projectionMatrix;
    matrix_float4x4 modelViewMatrix;
    float4x4 normalMatrix;        // Metal 3.0: Normal matrix for lighting
    float3 cameraPosition;        // Metal 3.0: Camera position for effects
    float time;                   // Metal 3.0: Time-based animations
} Uniforms;
```

#### New Vertex Attributes
- Added `VertexAttributeNormal` for normal mapping
- Updated vertex descriptor to support 20-byte stride (8 for texcoord + 12 for normal)
- Enhanced mesh creation with normal support

#### Advanced Rendering Pipeline
